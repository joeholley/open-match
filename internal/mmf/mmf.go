// MakeMatches is where your custom matchmaking logic lives.
// Input:
//  - profile : JSON blob input to the BackendAPI when you called ListMatches
//              or CreateMatch. It is the contents of the MatchObject 'Properties' field.
//  - rosters : an array of protobuf Roster messages. By convention, your input
//              Roster contains players already in the match and pools to search for each
//              empty slot. Feel free to get more fancy with it if you need more/different
//              structure.
//  - pools : An array of protobuf PlayerPool messages. Contains all the
//            players returned by the MMLogic API when asking it for the player pools.
//            Already had ignorelists applied as of the time the player pool was
//            gathered.
// Output:
//  - (results) string : JSON blob to put in the MatchObject 'Properties' field
//              send back as the response to your ListMatches or CreateMatch call.
//  - (rosters) []*api.Roster : Filled team rosters.  Use is optional but
//				recommended; you'll need to construct at least one Roster with all the
//  			players you're selecting before calling the MMLogic CreateProposal()
//  			endpoint, as it is read and used to add those players to the ignorelist.
//  			You'll also need all the players you want to assign to your DGS in
//  			Roster(s) when you call the BackendAPI CreateAssignments() endpoint.
//  - error :   Use if you need to return an unrecoverable error.
