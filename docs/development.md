# Development Guide

This doc explains how to setup a development environment so you can get started contributing to Open Match.  If you instead want to write a matchmaker that _uses_ Open Match, you probably want to read the [User Guide](user_guide.md). 

# Compiling from source

All components of Open Match produce (Linux) Docker container images as artifacts, and there are included `Dockerfile`s for each. [Google Cloud Platform Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/) users will also find `cloudbuild.yaml` files for each component in their respective directories.  Note that most of them build from an 'base' image called `openmatch-devbase`.  You can find a `Dockerfile` and `cloudbuild_base.yaml` file for this in the repository root.  Build it first! 

Note: Although Google Cloud Platform includes some free usage, you may incur charges following this guide if you use GCP products.

## Security Disclaimer
**This project has not completed a first-line security audit, and there are definitely going to be some service accounts that are too permissive.  This should be fine for testing/development in a local environment, but absolutely should not be used as-is in a production environment without your team/organization evaluating it's permissions.**

## Before getting started
**NOTE**: Before starting with this guide, you'll need to update all the URIs from the tutorial's gcr.io container image registry with the URI for your own image registry. If you are using the gcr.io registry on GCP, the default URI is `gcr.io/<PROJECT_NAME>`.  Here's an example command in Linux to do the replacement for you this (replace YOUR_REGISTRY_URI with your URI, this should be run from the repository root directory):
```
# Linux
egrep -lR 'matchmaker-dev-201405' . | xargs sed -i -e 's|matchmaker-dev-201405|<PROJECT_NAME>|g'
```
```
# Mac OS, you can delete the .backup files after if all looks good 
egrep -lR 'matchmaker-dev-201405' . | xargs sed -i'.backup' -e 's|matchmaker-dev-201405|<PROJECT_NAME>|g'
```

## Example of building using Google Cloud Builder

The [Quickstart for Docker](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-docker) guide explains how to set up a project, enable billing, enable Cloud Build, and install the Cloud SDK if you haven't do these things before. Once you get to 'Preparing source files' you are ready to continue with the steps below.

* Clone this repo to a local machine or Google Cloud Shell session, and cd into it.
* In Linux, you can run the following one-line bash script to compile all the images for the first time, and push them to your gcr.io registry. You must enable the [Container Registry API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=containerregistry.googleapis.com) first.
    ```
    # First, build the 'base' image.  Some other images depend on this so it must complete first.
    gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild_base.yaml
    # Build all other images. 
    for dfile in $(find . -name "Dockerfile" -iregex "./\(cmd\|test\|examples\)/.*"); do cd $(dirname ${dfile}); gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml & cd -; done
    ```
    Note: as of v0.3.0 alpha, the Python and PHP MMF examples still depend on the previous way of building until [issue #42, introducing new config management](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-match/issues/42) is resolved (apologies for the inconvenience):
    ```
    gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild_mmf_py3.yaml
    gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild_mmf_php.yaml
    ```
* Once the cloud builds have completed, you can verify that all the builds succeeded in the cloud console or by by checking the list of images in your **gcr.io** registry:
    ```
    gcloud container images list
    ```
    (your registry name will be different)
    ```
    NAME
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-backendapi
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-devbase
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-evaluator
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-frontendapi
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-mmf-golang-manual-simple
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-mmf-php-mmlogic-simple
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-mmf-py3-mmlogic-simple
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-mmforc
    gcr.io/matchmaker-dev-201405/openmatch-mmlogicapi
    ```
## Example of starting a GKE cluster

A cluster with mostly default settings will work for this development guide.  In the Cloud SDK command below we start it with machines that have 4 vCPUs.  Alternatively, you can use the 'Create Cluster' button in [Google Cloud Console]("https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes").

```
gcloud container clusters create --machine-type n1-standard-4 open-match-dev-cluster --zone <ZONE>
```

If you don't know which zone to launch the cluster in (`<ZONE>`), you can list all available zones by running the following command.

```
gcloud compute zones list
```

## Configuration

Currently, each component reads a local config file `matchmaker_config.json`, and all components assume they have the same configuration (if you would like to help us design the replacement config solution, please join the [discussion](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-match/issues/42).  To this end, there is a single centralized config file located in the `<REPO_ROOT>/config/` which is symlinked to each component's subdirectory for convenience when building locally.  Note: [there is an issue with symlinks on Windows](../issues/57).

## Running Open Match in a development environment

The rest of this guide assumes you have a cluster (example is using GKE, but works on any cluster with a little tweaking), and kubectl configured to administer that cluster, and you've built all the Docker container images described by `Dockerfiles` in the repository root directory and given them the docker tag 'dev'.  It assumes you are in the `<REPO_ROOT>/deployments/k8s/` directory.

* Start a copy of redis and a service in front of it:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f redis_deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f redis_service.yaml
    ```
* Run the **core components**: the frontend API, the backend API, the matchmaker function orchestrator (MMFOrc), and the matchmaking logic API.
**NOTE** In order to kick off jobs, the matchmaker function orchestrator needs a service account with permission to administer the cluster. This should be updated to have min required perms before launch, this is pretty permissive but acceptable for closed testing:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f backendapi_deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f backendapi_service.yaml
    kubectl apply -f frontendapi_deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f frontendapi_service.yaml
    kubectl apply -f mmforc_deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f mmforc_serviceaccount.yaml
    kubectl apply -f mmlogicapi_deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f mmlogicapi_service.yaml
    ```
* [optional, but recommended] Configure the OpenCensus metrics services:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f metrics_services.yaml
    ```
* [optional] Trying to apply the Kubernetes Prometheus Operator resource definition files without a cluster-admin rolebinding on GKE doesn't work without running the following command first. See https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/issues/357
    ```
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding projectowner-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=<GCP_ACCOUNT>
    ```
* [optional, uses beta software] If using Prometheus as your metrics gathering backend, configure the [Prometheus Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator):
    
    ```
    kubectl apply -f prometheus_operator.yaml
    kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml
    kubectl apply -f prometheus_service.yaml
    kubectl apply -f metrics_servicemonitor.yaml
    ```
You should now be able to see the core component pods running using a `kubectl get pods`, and the core component metrics in the Prometheus Web UI by running `kubectl proxy <PROMETHEUS_POD_NAME> 9090:9090` in your local shell, then opening http://localhost:9090/targets in your browser to see which services Prometheus is collecting from.

Here's an example output from `kubectl get all` if everything started correctly, and you included all the optional components (note: this could become out-of-date with upcoming versions; apologies if that happens):

### End-to-End testing

**Note**: The programs provided below are just bare-bones manual testing programs with no automation and no claim of code coverage. This sparseness of this part of the documentation is because we expect to discard all of these tools and write a fully automated end-to-end test suite and a collection of load testing tools, with extensive stats output and tracing capabilities before 1.0 release. Tracing has to be integrated first, which will be in an upcoming release.

In the end: *caveat emptor*. These tools all work and are quite small, and as such are fairly easy for developers to understand by looking at the code and logging output. They are provided as-is just as a reference point of how to begin experimenting with Open Match integrations.  

* `test/cmd/frontendclient/` is a fake client for the Frontend API.  It pretends to be group of real game clients connecting to Open Match.  It requests a game, then dumps out the results each player receives to the screen until you press the enter key. **Note**: If you're using the rest of these test programs, you're probably using the Backend Client below.  The default profiles that command sends to the backend look for many more than one player, so if you want to see meaningful results from running this Frontend Client, you're going to need to generate a bunch of fake players using the client load simulation tool at the same time. Otherwise, expect to wait until it times out as your matchmaker never has enough players to make a successful match.
* `examples/backendclient` is a fake client for the Backend API.  It pretends to be a dedicated game server backend connecting to openmatch and sending in a match profile to fill.  Once it receives a match object with a roster, it will also issue a call to assign the player IDs, and gives an example connection string.  If it never seems to get a match, make sure you're adding players to the pool using the other two tools. Note: building this image requires that you first build the 'base' dev image (look for `cloudbuild_base.yaml` and `Dockerfile.base` in the root directory) and then update the first step to point to that image in your registry.  This will be simplified in a future release.  **Note**: If you run this by itself, expect it to wait about 30 seconds, then return a result of 'insufficient players' and exit - this is working as intended.  Use the client load simulation tool below to add players to the pool or you'll never be able to make a successful match. 
* `test/cmd/clientloadgen/` is a (VERY) basic client load simulation tool.  It does **not** test the Frontend API - in fact, it ignores it and writes players directly to state storage on its own.  It doesn't do anything but loop endlessly, writing players into state storage so you can test your backend integration, and run your custom MMFs and Evaluators (which are only triggered when there are players in the pool).
