// The evaluator is, generalized, a weighted graph problem
// https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=computer+science+weighted+graph&oq=computer+science+weighted+graph
// However, it's up to the developer to decide what values in their matchmaking
// decision process are the weights as well as what to prioritize (make as many
// groups as possible is a common goal).  The default evaluator makes naive
// decisions under the assumption that most use cases would rather spend their
// time tweaking the profiles sent to matchmaking such that they are less and less
// likely to choose the same players.
