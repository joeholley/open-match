// OpenCensus Measures. These are exported as metrics to your monitoring system
// https://godoc.org/go.opencensus.io/stats
//
// When making opencensus stats, the 'name' param, with forward slashes changed
// to underscores, is appended to the 'namespace' value passed to the
// prometheus exporter to become the Prometheus metric name. You can also look
// into having Prometheus rewrite your metric names on scrape.
//
//  For example:
//   - defining the promethus export namespace "open_match" when instanciating the exporter:
//			pe, err := promethus.NewExporter(promethus.Options{Namespace: "openmatch"})
//     (This is in the internal/metrics module)
//   - and naming the request counter view "mmlogic/requests_total":
//			FnRequestCounterView = &view.View{
//				Name:        "mmlogic/requests_total"
//   - results in the prometheus metric name:
//			openmatch_mmlogic_requests_total
//   - [note] when using opencensus views to aggregate the metrics into
//     distribution buckets and such, multiple metrics
//     will be generated with appended types ("<metric>_bucket",
//     "<metric>_count", "<metric>_sum", for example)
//
// In addition, OpenCensus stats propogated to Prometheus have the following
// auto-populated labels pulled from kubernetes, which we should avoid to
// prevent overloading and having to use the HonorLabels param in Prometheus.
//
// - Information about the k8s pod being monitored:
//		"pod" (name of the monitored k8s pod)
//		"namespace" (k8s namespace of the monitored pod)
// - Information about how promethus is gathering the metrics:
//		"instance" (IP and port number being scraped by prometheus)
//		"job" (name of the k8s service being scraped by prometheus)
//		"endpoint" (name of the k8s port in the k8s service being scraped by prometheus)
